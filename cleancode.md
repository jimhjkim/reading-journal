## Day 2

> Chapter 1. Clean Code

> April 23, 2022

### Key points

- Lays out the motivations for writing clean code and the potential repurcussions if we check in dirty code

- Insights from prominent programmers on what writing clean code means

- 10:1 reading to writing code ratio

### Things to remember

- There will always be a need to write code even thought there are many who claim that code will be generated instead of being written.

- Bad code can put companies out of business or the total cost of owning a mess can be deterimental to company growth

- Programmers have a professional responsibility to write clean code even at the expense of pushing back against tight deadlines and schedules

- Clean code is readable

- No duplication, one thing, expressiveness, tiny abstractions

- Good code can degrade over time so maintainenace also has to be a priority

### Reflection

- With the advent of many machine learning solutions, I am curious to see if the author's hypothesis on the necessity to write code will hold in the near future.

- As a professional developer, I have a responsibility to write clean code, not just to complete requirements in the shortest amount of time. Communicating these needs to non-technical stakeholders is a skill that I should start developing.

- Making it easier to read actually makes it easier to write

- Leave the campground cleaner than you found it

### Things to further investigate

- What does code that has been take care of look like?

- How does one develop code sense?

## Day 3

> Chapter 2. Meaningful Names

> April 24, 2022

### Key points

- Use intention-revealing names and be serious about it!

- Use pronounceable and searchable names

- Pick one word per concept

### Things to remember

- Choosing good names takes time but saves more than it takes

- Avoid words whose entrenched meanings vary from our intended meaning (e.g., hp, aix, sco)

- Try not to add data types/encodings to the variable names

- Beware of names which vary in small ways

- Use consistent spelling to support automatic code completion in modern development environments

- Avoid using lowercase "L" and uppercase "O" as variable names as these are easily confused with "1" and "0", respectively

- Do not make minor modifications to please the compiler

- Use pronounceable names to support intelligent conversations

- Single letter variable names should only be used as local variables to support better searching

- The length of a name should correspond to the size of its scope

- Using the same word for "consistency" across class methods can increase clarity

### Reflection

- Thinking twice about variable names can go a long way in writing clear and professional code

- Suggesting these best practices may or may not be received well by other developers but it's best to try

- Naming is partly dependent on shared culture understanding. I wonder how this is achieved in more multicultural environemnts.

### Things to further investigate

- As I write code and explore new codebases, I should look out for these naming best practices and try to implement them.

## Day 4

> Review concepts by reading 3 posts by other participants

> April 25, 2022

### Post #1 by `cho7448-3divcs`

- I liked the fact that she pointed out the "shared culutural" understanding as a key point from the chapter.

- I liked how every point from the chapter was summarized with examples listed in parenthesis.

- Reflection on how we try to put every detail into variable names is relatable.

### Post #2 by `npolly7`

- Very concise summary of the chapter

- Reflection on how including encoding in the variable name helped the writer at work made me think twice about the advice given in the chapter as well.

### Post #3 by `minn`

- Reflecting on past professional experiences where bad variable names hampered development is encouraging me to think twice before choosing variable names at work
