## Chapter 1. Clean Code

> April 23, 2022

### Key points

- Lays out the motivations for writing clean code and the potential repurcussions if we check in dirty code

- Insights from prominent programmers on what writing clean code means

- 10:1 reading to writing code ratio

### Things to remember

- There will always be a need to write code even thought there are many who claim that code will be generated instead of being written.

- Bad code can put companies out of business or the total cost of owning a mess can be deterimental to company growth

- Programmers have a professional responsibility to write clean code even at the expense of pushing back against tight deadlines and schedules

- Clean code is readable

- No duplication, one thing, expressiveness, tiny abstractions

- Good code can degrade over time so maintainenace also has to be a priority

### Reflection

- With the advent of many machine learning solutions, I am curious to see if the author's hypothesis on the necessity to write code will hold in the near future.

- As a professional developer, I have a responsibility to write clean code, not just to complete requirements in the shortest amount of time. Communicating these needs to non-technical stakeholders is a skill that I should start developing.

- Making it easier to read actually makes it easier to write

- Leave the campground cleaner than you found it

### Things to further investigate

- What does code that has been take care of look like?

- How does one develop code sense?
